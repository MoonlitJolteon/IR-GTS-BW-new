> "IR-GTS is a Python script that allows users to send and receive individual Pokemon from retail NDS carts using the GTS feature added in Generation IV."

## Server functions not available

Since Nintendo's shutdown of all old Pokemon games' servers, including the GTS, none of the GTS-specific functions for this project will work. Analysis features should still work fine. A workaround for the server shutdown is being looked into. Until then, all new commits will be marked as unstable, with new experimental features being added that might not work. **You have been warned.**
